Nice work on this!  You have done a good job with the data dictionary, but it's
not very apparent where the split is between the two sections... you seem to
have described the entire Amplify database in both of the documents for the
two teams!!  ....but whatever, they are still done independently and look just
fine.


Overall, VERY NICE WORK!

you have 10% out of 10% which is 100% on this deliverable for an A-plus
