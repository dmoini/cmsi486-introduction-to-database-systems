This is very good work.  You have addessed all of the required topics.

I like the layout of your ERD, very simple and straightforward.  You have
a complete idea without a lot of extra stuff.  You might consider a relation
between Userinfo and Track to help normalize the relationship and keep from
having to parse arrays of tracks in the Userinfo table.

Overall, VERY NICE WORK!

you have 10% out of 10% which is 100% on this deliverable for an A-plus
